# Goal

- Assess whether the Android Notein app on the user's tablet can be brought to Windows with PC-side writing and file-based synchronization through Syncthing instead of Notein cloud sync.
- Prioritize a clean-room handwriting engine that reproduces Notein's pen character and low apparent latency, because both the compatibility route and an independent product need it.
- Preserve the user's existing Notein data. Reverse engineering is for interoperability with the user's own notes; do not publish proprietary app code or keys.

# Current State

- Repository was initialized with feasibility commit `817787a`; it has no remote.
- Tablet is reachable through wireless ADB at `192.168.31.243:42857` (Xiaomi `23046RP50C`, Android 15 / API 35, arm64); mDNS service `adb-cd94ae18-SyxYs4` confirms the endpoint.
- Installed China package: `com.orion.notein`, `v2.0.10.0` (`versionCode=343`, `minSdk=26`, `targetSdk=35`), single 114,190,617-byte APK, installed from Xiaomi Market.
- APK is non-debuggable and app-private `/data/user/0/com.orion.notein` cannot be read with `run-as`.
- App-specific external files are readable at `/sdcard/Android/data/com.orion.notein/files`; current snapshot is about 256 MiB / 5,638 files, mainly UUID-named blobs and PNGs.
- Static scan shows a native Android/Kotlin/Java app, not Flutter/React Native. It includes arm64-only native libraries such as `libink.so`, PDFium, OpenCV, SQLiteX, and Baidu Protect. Xiaomi CloudKit database/file sync providers are bundled.
- Runtime resources and logs show that editable data depends on a private `NoteContentDatabaseProvider`; the readable external directory is predominantly PNG previews.
- A user-authorized full local backup was created through Android's save picker as `/sdcard/Download/backup.zip` (1,579,602,577 bytes). Keep the tablet copy; the analysis copy is temporary and must not be committed.
- The backup is an unencrypted ZIP containing 167 per-note `.in` nested ZIPs, two `.template` entries, and one `.tree`; per-note containers include a Room/SQLite v25 database and metadata, plus source PDFs when applicable.
- Notein uses AndroidX Ink 1.0.0 exactly: its arm64 `libink.so` matches the Google Maven artifact in size and ELF Build ID.
- Android lab v0.1.0 is built and installed as `com.meta.inklab.debug`. It has no Internet/storage permission and runs alongside the untouched Notein package.
- The installed lab uses AndroidX Ink wet/dry authoring, motion prediction, one adjustable fountain-pen stroke, prediction toggle, undo, and clear. Controls are width 0.1–2.0 mm, pressure 0–400%, and ink flow 0–200%, with Notein-observed defaults 0.4 mm / 200% / 100%.
- Design records:
  - `docs/design/sync-architecture.md` (read before synchronization or note-format work).
  - `docs/design/handwriting-engine.md` (read before ink-input, brush, rendering, or tablet-lab work).

# Active Work

- [x] Establish ADB access and identify the exact installed package/version.
- [x] Capture first-pass APK/runtime/storage architecture evidence.
- [x] Decompile resources far enough to locate the supported local-backup path and distinguish it from cloud sync/backup.
- [x] Inspect representative user-owned external blobs without exposing note content; sampled UUID blobs are PNG previews.
- [x] Determine initial feasibility: direct source port is not practical; a clean-room companion is conditional on the supported backup format.
- [x] Write the synchronization design boundary before implementation.
- [x] Create and inspect an app-supported full local backup without modifying Notein's live private data.
- [x] Prove a read-only structural parser for the outer backup, per-note containers, Room schema, and stroke record families.
- [x] Identify the exact AndroidX Ink native version and persisted `notein-fountain-v1` pressure/speed settings.
- [x] Build, lint, install, and runtime-check a separate no-network Android handwriting lab for real stylus A/B testing.
- [ ] Collect the user's unplugged subjective feedback on the single adjustable stroke, especially nib alignment, taper, and pressure/ink-flow response.
- [ ] Prove a read-only Notein stroke renderer before any write-back experiment.

# Build / Run / Test

- ADB binary: `C:\Users\Meta\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\platform-tools\adb.exe`.
- Verify device: `adb devices -l`.
- Installed package path: `adb shell pm path com.orion.notein`.
- APK inspection tools currently available: Android SDK `apkanalyzer`, Java 17. `jadx` is not globally installed; use a temporary portable copy if needed.
- Keep device probes read-only until a tested backup/restore strategy exists. Do not enable Notein cloud sync or write into its live data directory during format discovery.
- Initial handwriting lab package must remain `com.meta.inklab`, request no network/storage permission, and store no durable user content.
- Lab build and lint: from `android`, run `.\gradlew.bat :app:assembleDebug :app:lintDebug`.
- Debug APK: `android\app\build\outputs\apk\debug\app-debug.apk`; installed debug package/activity: `com.meta.inklab.debug/com.meta.inklab.MainActivity`.
- HyperOS rejects streamed ADB installs with `INSTALL_FAILED_USER_RESTRICTED`. Use Xiaomi File Manager and the installer menu's one-time `单次安装授权`; do not enable a persistent global install setting.

# Durable Lessons

- Notein metadata and document blobs are split across Android app-private and app-specific external storage. Syncthing of only `/Android/data/com.orion.notein/files` is not yet proven complete or safe.
- The installed China build differs from the global Play package (`com.orion.notein.global`); do not assume global-package paths or backup behavior apply.
- Launching Notein can immediately activate configured Huawei Drive/analytics components. Keep it force-stopped during static work and avoid launches that are not needed for a deliberate local-backup experiment.
- Notein 2.0.10.0 uses the exact AndroidX Ink 1.0.0 arm64 native library. Reproduce the public Ink input/rendering pipeline and clean-room brush behavior; do not spend effort bypassing Baidu Protect.
- The current new-stroke population consistently uses `notein-fountain-v1`, `pressure_correct=2.0`, `speed_correct=1.0`, and epsilon `0.01`; keep these as versioned evidence, not as proof of the full private brush graph.
- Notein's displayed percentages map directly to persisted correction values by dividing by 100. Preserve that boundary mapping, but do not call the lab's downstream curve Notein's curve until the runtime brush graph is recovered.
- This tablet's input becomes unstable while charging. Test brush behavior unplugged and keep charger-induced digitizer noise separate from smoothing or prediction conclusions.
- Android 15 edge-to-edge enforcement can put a custom rail under system bars. Apply actual system-bar insets and verify on the real portrait tablet, not only with a successful build.
